# Carbonance

A Personal Finance and Carbon Footprint Manager Application

## Overview 

Carbonance is no longer just a smart budgeting tool; it is a comprehensive financial and sustainability platform. It delivers on the promise of "Track Once, See More" by combining financial tracking with carbon footprint analysis in a single, effortless step. By automatically linking financial transactions with their environmental impact, users can effortlessly monitor both their spending habits and emissions.

Beyond tracking and insights, Carbonance empowers users to take direct action. Through a variety of offsetting options—from completing green lifestyle missions to contributing to verified carbon reduction campaigns—users can turn their insights into tangible impact.

But the app's mission extends further. Carbonance rewards a user's commitment with Green Finance, where green actions earn valuable credits that can unlock access to loans and funds for sustainable investments like electric vehicles and solar panels.

With Carbonance, financial planning and sustainability go hand in hand, transforming daily routines into a rewarding journey toward a greener future, without ever disrupting your life.

## Features

### 1. Track

Track helps users understand the environmental impact of their financial habits by making carbon data both visible and actionable. It combines expense and income tracking with carbon footprint logging in a single flow. Users can input data manually or by scanning receipts, while smart AI auto-categorizes each transaction for deeper financial and environmental insights. With Open Banking integration, spending data can be synced automatically from wallets or banks. Carbon emissions are calculated using the formula: kg CO₂e = Emission Factor × Spend Amount, where the emission factor is based on models like EE-MRIO and DSBF, and adjusted by factors such as spending category (MCC), taxes, margins, inflation, region, and currency.

### 2. View

View transforms the user's logged transactions and activities into clear, easy-to-understand carbon reports, making their environmental impact more transparent. It also delivers personalized and actionable recommendations based on the user's spending and lifestyle patterns, guiding them toward smarter, greener choices.

### 3. Act

Act empowers users to take meaningful steps toward offsetting their carbon footprint. Through campaign offsets, users can support large-scale, verified carbon reduction projects. Personal offsets encourage greener lifestyles by completing eco-focused missions and challenges. Additionally, users can drive sustainable change by choosing to shop with environmentally responsible businesses and brands.

### 4. Impact

Impact encourages users to make green choices a natural part of everyday life by connecting financial decisions with sustainability. Through green finance, users can access eco-friendly funds and loans that support environmental initiatives. Green rewards offer discounts and incentives for choosing low-carbon products and services, making sustainable living easier and more rewarding.
