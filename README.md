# Carbonance

"Money Matters. So does the planet"

## Overview 

Carbonance is no longer just a smart budgeting tool; it is a comprehensive financial and sustainability platform. It delivers on the promise of "Track Once, See More" by combining financial tracking with carbon footprint analysis in a single, effortless step. By automatically linking financial transactions with their environmental impact, users can effortlessly monitor both their spending habits and emissions.

Beyond tracking and insights, Carbonance empowers users to take direct action. Through a variety of offsetting options—from completing green lifestyle missions to contributing to verified carbon reduction campaigns—users can turn their insights into tangible impact.

But the app's mission extends further. Carbonance rewards a user's commitment with Green Finance, where green actions earn valuable credits that can unlock access to loans and funds for sustainable investments like electric vehicles and solar panels.

With Carbonance, financial planning and sustainability go hand in hand, transforming daily routines into a rewarding journey toward a greener future, without ever disrupting your life.

## Features

### 1. Smart Expense and Carbon Tracker

Carbonance offers users a seamless solution to track daily expenses (bills, groceries, transport) with automatic categorization and date sorting, uniquely integrating carbon footprint analysis for each transaction. Utilizing Gemini AI and the Connect Earth API, the app calculates and logs the environmental impact alongside financial data, empowering users to understand their spending and its carbon footprint. Carbonance provides flexible logging through text, image, voice command via a virtual pet, automatic bank and e-wallet (TNG, GrabPay) sync, AI-powered receipt scanning with Google Vision, and manual entry, enriched with details like images, location, time, and payment method to facilitate informed financial and sustainable choices.

### 2. Virtual Pet

Carbonance's Virtual Pet feature enhances user engagement in financial and carbon footprint management through an interactive AI assistant powered by Gemini API. This customizable digital companion delivers daily, personalized financial insights, spending analysis, and eco-friendly suggestions via an engaging chat interface. Users can also seamlessly log expenses and access other app features using natural language or picture input to the pet. To increase user stickiness, the pet offers personalization options with unlockable wardrobe items earned by completing quests focused on responsible financial habits and eco-conscious actions, transforming expense tracking into a more interactive and rewarding experience.

### 3. Visualisation and Insights

Carbonance’s dashboard visually summarizes user finances and environmental impact with interactive charts of spending categories and AI-driven analysis highlighting trends and unusual expenses. It integrates real-time carbon footprint tracking for each transaction, displayed in clear charts, and offers AI-powered recommendations for reducing both costs and environmental impact. This ensures that users don't just see their data, but also receive tailored advice that promotes informed and sustainable choices.

### 4. Carbon Offset

Users are empowered to take tangible action to reduce their footprint. They can participate in Personal Offset by completing green lifestyle missions and challenges, or contribute to Campaign Offset by funding large-scale, verified carbon reduction projects. A discovery page for Green Businesses also encourages conscious consumption. A Leaderboard fosters friendly competition, motivating users to pursue their goals within a supportive and engaging environment.

### 5. Green Finance and Rewards

This feature rewards user commitment, making green choices a part of their life. Green actions earn credits that can be redeemed for Green Rewards—vouchers, discounts, and exclusive offers from sustainable businesses. These credits also unlock access to Green Finance, providing exclusive loans and funds for sustainable investments like electric vehicles and solar panels, turning a user's positive impact into a tangible financial advantage.
